## 🛠 Installation Steps

Below is the detailed walkthrough for your **Media Creation Tool Windows 10 download** and usage across different platforms.

### 🖥 Windows & macOS

#### For Windows Users
Since this is a native Windows application, the process is straightforward:

1.  **Media Creation Tool Windows 10 Free Download:** Download the executable file from the official source.
2.  **Launch:** Double-click the `.exe` file. You may need to accept the UAC (User Account Control) prompt.
3.  **Select Architecture:** If creating media for another PC, uncheck "Use the recommended options for this PC" to select the Language, Edition, and Architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) manually.
4.  **Choose Media:**
    *   **USB Flash Drive:** Requires a drive with at least 8GB of space (Note: All data on the drive will be deleted).
    *   **ISO File:** Saves a file to your PC that you can burn to a DVD later.
5.  **Finish:** Let the tool process the files. Once done, your USB is ready to boot!

#### For macOS Users
*Note: The **Media Creation Tool** `.exe` file does not run natively on macOS.*

To get Windows 10 on a Mac (via Boot Camp or Parallels), you do not use the tool directly. Instead:
1.  Visit the Microsoft download page using your Safari or Chrome browser on macOS.
2.  The site detects you are not on Windows and will offer a direct **Windows 10 ISO download** instead of the Media Creation Tool.
3.  Download the ISO image.
4.  Use the **macOS Boot Camp Assistant** to install Windows using that ISO file.

### 🐧 Linux

Similar to macOS, the **Media Creation Tool download Windows 8**, 10, or 11 executable will not run natively on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) without compatibility layers like WINE, which can be unstable for system-level operations.

**The Workaround:**
1.  Open your Linux web browser.
2.  Go to the Microsoft Windows 10 download page.
3.  Because the browser identifies a non-Windows OS, Microsoft will allow you to directly download the **Windows 10 ISO** file.
4.  Use a Linux tool like **WoeUSB** or **BalenaEtcher** to flash the ISO onto a USB drive to create your bootable media.
